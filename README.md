## Overview
- A QR code card for basic HTML and CSS. No responsive layouts needed. Figma was used for the design.

## My Process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS

### Steps
- I looked at the attributes in the Figma design, copied the fonts from GoogleFonts, and planned out my QR-code build. After formatting the HTML to have a contact-wrapper around the card and a text-wrapper around the h1 and p elements, I started work on the CSS. 

- I formatted the fonts, aligned the text, and added paddings and margins. Then I adjusted the box-radius and matched the colors. After the initial submittion, I added a desktop media screen to adjust the card placement and validated my code.

### What I learned
- This was my first time working with Figma. I learned where the color codes are and really enjoyed the Alt key feature to measure distances between items.

### Continued development
- I'd like to become more familiar the with box-shadow elements.
